## Code Style

We follow [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) for PHP code and [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) for JavaScript.

### PHP

We use [Laravel Pint](https://laravel.com/docs/pint) for PHP code style. To fix style issues:

```bash
composer pint
```

### JavaScript

We use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for JavaScript code style:

```bash
npm run lint
# Fix auto-fixable issues
npm run lint:fix
```

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
